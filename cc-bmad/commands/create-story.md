Scrum Master로서 **스토리 생성** 워크플로우를 실행합니다.

## Workflow Overview

**Goal:** Create detailed user story document for a single story

**Phase:** 4 - Implementation (Story Definition)

**Agent:** Scrum Master

**Inputs:** Story ID or description, sprint plan (if exists)

**Output:** `docs/stories/STORY-{ID}.md`

**Duration:** 10-20 minutes per story

**When to use:** When you want detailed story documentation before implementation

---

## Pre-Flight

1. **Load context** per `helpers.md#Combined-Config-Load`
2. **Check sprint status** per `helpers.md#Load-Sprint-Status`
3. **Load sprint plan** (if exists): `docs/sprint-plan-*.md`
4. **Get story input:**
   - If user provides STORY-ID: Find it in sprint plan
   - If user provides description: Create new story
5. **Load ZenHub context** per `helpers.md#Load-ZenHub-Context`
6. **Check epic ZenHub ID:** If story's epic has `zh_epic_id` in sprint status, store for parent linking

---

## Story Creation Process

Use TodoWrite to track: Pre-flight → Gather Info → Define Story → Acceptance Criteria → Technical Details → Dependencies → Generate → Update Status → ZenHub Sync

Approach: **Organized, pragmatic, detail-oriented.**

---

### Part 1: Story Identification

**If story ID provided (e.g., "STORY-001"):**
1. Load sprint plan
2. Find story by ID
3. Extract existing details (title, epic, points, basic description)
4. Expand with full details

**If description provided:**
1. Generate next story ID (check sprint status for last ID)
2. Ask user for epic/category
3. Ask user for priority
4. Proceed with story creation

---

### Part 2: Define User Story

**Core user story format:**
```
As a {user type}
I want to {capability}
So that {benefit}
```

**Ask user (if not from sprint plan):**
> "Let's define the user story. Who is the user and what do they want to accomplish?"

**Good user stories:**
- As a **customer**, I want to **view my order history**, so that **I can track past purchases**
- As an **administrator**, I want to **manage user roles**, so that **I can control access permissions**
- As a **registered user**, I want to **reset my password**, so that **I can regain access if I forget it**

**Bad user stories:**
- "Implement user login" (not user-focused)
- "Create database table" (too technical, no user value)
- "Fix bug in checkout" (that's a bug fix, not a story)

**Store as:** `{{user_story}}`

---

### Part 3: Detailed Description

**Expand on the user story:**

Ask: "What's the detailed context and scope for this story?"

**Include:**
- **Background:** Why is this needed? What problem does it solve?
- **Scope:** What's included? What's explicitly out of scope?
- **User flow:** Step-by-step what the user does

**Example:**
```markdown
## Description

### Background
Currently, users cannot recover their accounts if they forget passwords. This leads to support tickets and frustrated users. This story implements a self-service password reset flow.

### Scope
**In scope:**
- Email-based password reset link
- Secure token generation (expires in 1 hour)
- Password strength validation
- Success confirmation

**Out of scope:**
- SMS-based reset (future enhancement)
- Password history tracking
- Account recovery via security questions

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot Password" on login page
2. User enters email address
3. System sends reset link to email
4. User clicks link (opens reset page)
5. User enters new password (with confirmation)
6. System validates password strength
7. System updates password
8. User sees success message
9. User is redirected to login
```

**Store as:** `{{description}}`, `{{scope}}`, `{{user_flow}}`

---

### Part 4: Acceptance Criteria

**Define testable acceptance criteria:**

**Format:**
```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User can request password reset from login page
- [ ] System sends email with reset link within 1 minute
- [ ] Reset link contains secure, expiring token (1-hour validity)
- [ ] User can set new password meeting strength requirements:
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- [ ] System validates password confirmation matches
- [ ] Expired tokens show clear error message
- [ ] Invalid tokens show clear error message
- [ ] Successful reset shows confirmation and redirects to login
- [ ] User can login with new password immediately
- [ ] Old password no longer works after reset
```

**Guidelines:**
- Each criterion should be testable (pass/fail)
- Use specific, measurable language
- Cover happy path and error cases
- Include edge cases
- Typical count: 5-12 criteria per story

**Ask user:** "What else must work for this story to be complete?"

**Store as:** `{{acceptance_criteria}}`

---

### Part 5: Technical Notes

**Implementation guidance for developers:**

Ask: "Any technical details developers should know?"

**Include:**
- **Components involved:** Which parts of the codebase
- **APIs/endpoints:** New or modified APIs
- **Database changes:** Schema changes, migrations
- **Third-party services:** External integrations
- **Edge cases:** Special scenarios to handle
- **Security considerations:** Auth, encryption, validation

**Example:**
```markdown
## Technical Notes

### Components
- **Backend:** User service, email service, auth service
- **Frontend:** Login page, password reset pages (request, reset)
- **Database:** users table (add reset_token, reset_token_expiry columns)

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/request-password-reset` - Initiate reset
  - Input: { email }
  - Output: { success, message }
- `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Complete reset
  - Input: { token, new_password, confirm_password }
  - Output: { success, message }
- `GET /api/auth/validate-reset-token/{token}` - Check token validity
  - Output: { valid, expired, message }

### Database Changes
```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN reset_token VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN reset_token_expiry TIMESTAMP;
CREATE INDEX idx_reset_token ON users(reset_token);
```

### Security Considerations
- Generate cryptographically secure random tokens (use crypto.randomBytes)
- Hash tokens before storing in database
- Set token expiry to 1 hour
- Rate limit reset requests (max 3 per hour per email)
- Sanitize email input to prevent injection
- Use HTTPS for all reset links

### Edge Cases
- User requests multiple resets (invalidate previous tokens)
- Reset link clicked after expiry (clear error message)
- Email doesn't exist (don't reveal, generic success message)
- Password doesn't meet requirements (clear validation errors)
```

**Store as:** `{{technical_notes}}`

---

### Part 6: Story Points Estimation

**If not already estimated:**

Ask: "How complex is this story? Let's estimate story points."

**Factors to consider:**
- Business logic complexity
- Number of components to change
- Testing complexity
- Unknowns or research needed
- Dependencies on other work

**Apply Fibonacci scale:**
- 1: Trivial (1-2 hours)
- 2: Simple (2-4 hours)
- 3: Moderate (4-8 hours)
- 5: Complex (1-2 days)
- 8: Very Complex (2-3 days)
- 13: Too large (BREAK DOWN)

**For password reset example:**
- Backend API endpoints: 3 points
- Database migration: 1 point
- Frontend pages: 3 points
- Email integration: 2 points
- Testing: 2 points
- **Total: 11 points → Round to 8 (or break into 2 stories: backend 5, frontend 5)**

**Store as:** `{{story_points}}`

---

### Part 7: Dependencies

**Identify dependencies:**

**Technical dependencies:**
- What must be done before this story?
- What other stories does this block?

**External dependencies:**
- Third-party services (email provider)
- Design assets (mockups, icons)
- Infrastructure (email sending configured)

**Example:**
```markdown
## Dependencies

**Prerequisite Stories:**
- STORY-001: User registration (must have users to reset passwords)
- STORY-002: Email service setup (need email sending capability)

**Blocked Stories:**
- None (password reset doesn't block other features)

**External Dependencies:**
- SendGrid API configured and tested
- Password strength validation library installed (zxcvbn)
- Email templates designed and approved
```

**Store as:** `{{dependencies}}`

---

### Part 8: Definition of Done

**Standard DoD (customize as needed):**

```markdown

---

### Part 9.5: Sub-task Decomposition (Optional)

**Skip if zh_sub_tasks_enabled = false or story points < sub_tasks.min_story_points.**

If sub-tasks are enabled and story is large enough:

1. **Auto-generate sub-tasks** per `helpers.md#Auto-Generate-Sub-tasks`:
   - Parse the story's acceptance criteria → validation sub-tasks
   - Parse technical notes → implementation sub-tasks
   - Parse definition of done → test sub-tasks

2. **Present sub-task preview:**
   ```
   Suggested Sub-tasks for STORY-{ID} ({points} pts):

   Implementation:
     1. {implementation_task_1}
     2. {implementation_task_2}

   Validation:
     3. Validate: {AC_1_summary}
     4. Validate: {AC_2_summary}

   Testing:
     5. Test: {test_scenario}

   Total: {count} sub-tasks

   Add these sub-tasks? (y/n/edit)
   ```

3. **If approved:**
   - Store sub-tasks in story document under "## Sub-tasks" section
   - Sub-tasks will be synced to ZenHub in Part 10 (if zh_available)

4. **Add to story document:**
   ```markdown
   ## Sub-tasks

   | # | Title | Type | Status |
   |---|-------|------|--------|
   | 1 | {title} | Implementation | Not Started |
   | 2 | {title} | Validation | Not Started |
   | 3 | {title} | Test | Not Started |
   ```

---

## Update Sprint Status

**If sprint status exists:**

Per `helpers.md#Update-Sprint-Status`:
1. Find story in sprint status YAML
2. Update story status to "defined"
3. Add story document path
4. Save status file

**If story is new:**
1. Add to current sprint in sprint status
2. Increment story count
3. Add points to sprint total

---

## Part 10: Sync to ZenHub

**Skip this part if `zh_available = false`.**

1. **Build story body** for GitHub issue from the generated story document:
   - Include: User Story, Description, Acceptance Criteria, Technical Notes
   - Format as markdown

2. **Call `helpers.md#Sync-Story-to-ZenHub`** with:
   - story_title: Story title (from Part 1)
   - story_body: Compiled markdown content
   - story_points: Estimated points (from Part 6)
   - zh_epic_id: Parent epic's ZenHub ID (from Pre-Flight step 6, if available)
   - sprint_id: `zh_active_sprint.id` (if story belongs to current sprint)
   - pipeline_id: `zh_pipelines["Sprint Backlog"]`

3. **Call `helpers.md#Store-ZenHub-Cross-Reference`**:
   - Update story document with ZenHub link
   - Update sprint-status.yaml with zh_issue_id, zh_issue_number, zh_issue_url

4. **Log result:** `✓ Story synced to ZenHub: #{issue_number} ({url})`

5. **Sync Sub-tasks** (if zh_sub_tasks_enabled and sub-tasks were created in Part 9.5):

   For each sub-task from Part 9.5:
   a. Generate sub-task body per `helpers.md#Generate-Sub-task-Body`
   b. Call `helpers.md#Sync-Sub-task-to-ZenHub`:
      - sub_task_title, sub_task_body
      - zh_story_id (parent, from step 2 above)
   c. Store zh_sub_task_id, issue number, URL
   d. Log: `✓ Sub-task synced: #{sub_issue_number} (parent: #{story_issue_number})`

6. **Update sprint-status.yaml** with sub_tasks array:
   ```yaml
   sub_tasks:
     - id: "sub-task-001"
       title: "{title}"
       status: "not-started"
       zh_issue_id: "{zh_sub_task_id}"
       zh_issue_number: {number}
       zh_issue_url: "{url}"
       zh_pipeline: "Sprint Backlog"
   ```

## Tips for Good Stories

**INVEST criteria:**
- **Independent:** Can be developed independently
- **Negotiable:** Details can be discussed
- **Valuable:** Delivers user value
- **Estimable:** Team can estimate effort
- **Small:** Fits in a sprint
- **Testable:** Has clear acceptance criteria

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Too technical (focus on user value, not implementation)
- Too large (break down >8 point stories)
- No acceptance criteria (how do you know it's done?)
- Missing dependencies (blocks progress)
- Vague description (leads to confusion)

---

## Notes for LLMs

- Maintain approach (organized, pragmatic)
- Use TodoWrite to track 8 story creation steps
- Ensure acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- Include technical details to guide implementation
- Apply INVEST criteria
- Reference helpers.md for status operations
- Generate complete, production-ready story documents
- Hand off to Developer for implementation

- After generating the story document locally, sync to ZenHub (Part 10) if zh_available
- Use `createGitHubIssue` with `[Story]` prefix per workspace convention
- Link story to parent epic via zh_epic_id if available
- Store ZenHub cross-reference in both story doc and sprint-status.yaml
- Sub-task decomposition (Part 9.5) is optional: only for stories >= min_story_points when zh_sub_tasks_enabled
- Sub-tasks are synced to ZenHub after the parent story (they need zh_story_id as parent)
- Use Generate Body helpers for consistent issue formatting
- If ZenHub sync fails, warn and continue — local document is still valid

**Remember:** A well-defined story = smooth development. Vague stories = confusion, rework, and delays.
